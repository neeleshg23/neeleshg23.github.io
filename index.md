I am a third-year CS undergrad in the [Data Science Lab](https://dslab.usc.edu/) at USC, advised by [Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/) and [Prof. Rajgopal Kannan](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kannan/Rajgopal). I am interested in model-architecture and algorithm-architecture HW/SW co-design for practical edge ML deployments. In the past, I've worked on ML for data prefetching to target practical AI-empowered computer architectures. I want to work on accelerating compute-intensive applications for graph analytics and computer vision.<br>

## Leetcode 2447 Medium Number of Subarrays With GCD Equal to K
### Question

Given arr and k, return the number of subarrays of nums where the greatest common divisor of the subarray's is k.

### Examples
nums = [9,3,1,2,6,3], k = 3 -> 4
'3' is the first cont. subarray of nums w GCD 3
The second '3' is the second subarray.
'3,9' is the the third subarray of size 2.
The fourth subarray is '6,3.' 
A single instance of k has GCD k.

nums = [4], k = 7 -> 0

### Work

Brute Force:
res = 0
N = len(arr)
NumDivByK = 0
for start = 0 -> N:
    for end = start -> N:
        int currGCD = arr[start]
        for i = start -> end:
        //iteratively find the greatest commond divisor of two numbers (i and currGCD)
            temp = arr[i]
            while (temp != currGDC) {
                if (currGCD > temp){
                    currGCD -= temp;
                }else{
                    temp -= currGCD;
                }
            }
            if (currGCD == k) res++
return res

This is obviously very slow, so we can move some work out with a function. 

int gcd(int a, int b){
    if b == 0 return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b)
}

Let us think of the way to find subarrays starting with subarrays we have already found with an example

nums = [16,8,4,1,4,4], k = 4

We want a way to not check numbers twice. ONLY AFTER FINDING AN INSTANCE OF A SUBARRAY OF SIZE 1, CAN YOU HAVE A SUBARRAY OF SIZE 2.

For a single number's greatest divisor to be k, it must be k.

1. First check if the number is k and we are starting a new subarray.
2. Check if the left or right neighbors are divisibe by k, then there is 1 more subarray.

16 GCD 16
| 
8 GCD 8
|
4 is k +1
|
|-- left [8,4] +1
    |
    |-- left [16,8,4] +1 -> return
|
|-- right [4,1] -> return
|
1 GCD 1 
|
4 is K+1
| 
|-- left[1,4] -> return
|
|--right[4,4] +1
   |
   |--left -> return
   |
   |-- right -> return
|
4 is k +1
|
|--left[4,4] DOUBLE COUNTING

### PSEUDOCODE

func subarrGCD(arr, int k):
    N = len(arr)
    left = 0
    right = 1
    return helper(arr, left, right,N, k)

helper(arr, left, right, k):
    if left, right, k, N valid
    if left-right is 1, start a new subarray if k array... 
        check left  + 1
        check right + 1
    else if new one creates a new valid array
        check left again + 1
        check right again + 1
